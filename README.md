## Tips from the book

### Chapter 1

“When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the program’s code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature, then add the feature.”

“Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.”
