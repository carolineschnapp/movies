# New requirements

First, we want a statement printed in HTML.

Secondly, we want to make changes to the way we classify movies, but we havenâ€™t yet decided on the change we are going to make. For sure, the changes will affect both the way renters are charged for movies and the way that frequent renter points are calculated.
